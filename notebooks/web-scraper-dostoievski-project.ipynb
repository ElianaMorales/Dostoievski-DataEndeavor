    "**Description:**\n",
    "This web scraper is designed to collect data on Fyodor Dostoevsky's literary works, including the titles, publication years, and additional information. The scraper targets a specific website that contains a curated list of Dostoevsky's works along with publication details. Using Python and popular libraries such as BeautifulSoup and pandas, the script navigates through the HTML structure of the webpage, extracts relevant information, and organizes it into a structured DataFrame. The resulting dataset provides a comprehensive overview of Dostoevsky's works, facilitating further analysis and exploration within a Jupyter notebook environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The obtained dataset is not only organized within a Jupyter notebook but also seamlessly exported to a Google Sheet through the Google Sheets API. This integration enables real-time collaboration, storage, and further analysis of the collected data on the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dependencies:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* beautifulsoup4: For parsing HTML content.\n",
    "* pandas: For data manipulation and storage.\n",
    "* requests: For fetching HTML content from the website.\n",
