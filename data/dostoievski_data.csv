Standalone Novels,The Insulted and Injured,1861,"1915. Dostoevsky, Russian novelist, is considered one of the most outstanding and influential writers of modern literature. In The Insulted and Injured he first explores one of his major themes, the beneficial effects of suffering. The novel begins: Last year, on the evening of March 22, I had a very strange adventure. All that day I had been walking about the town trying to find a lodging. My old one was very damp, and I had begun to have an ominous cough. Ever since the autumn I had been meaning to move, but I had hung on till the spring. I had not been able to find anything decent all day. In the first place I wanted a separate tenement, not a room in other people’s lodgings; secondly, though I could do with one room, it must be a large one, and, of course, it had at the same time to be as cheap as possible. I have observed that in a confined space even thought is cramped. When I was brooding over a future novel I liked to walk up and down the room. By the way, I always like better brooding over my works and dreaming how they should be written than actually writing them. And this really is not from laziness. Why is it?

Few authors have been as personally familiar with desperation as Fyodor Dostoevsky, and none have been so adept at describing it. Crime and Punishment the novel that heralded the author’s period of masterworks tells the story of the poor and talented student Raskolnikov, a character of unparalleled psychological depth and complexity. Raskolnikov reasons that men like himself, by virtue of their intellectual superiority, can and must transcend societal law. To test his theory, he devises the perfect crime the murder of a spiteful pawnbroker living in St. Petersburg. In one of the most gripping crime stories of all time, Raskolnikov soon realizes the folly of his abstractions. Haunted by vivid hallucinations and the torments of his conscience, he seeks relief from his terror and moral isolation first from Sonia, the pious streetwalker who urges him to confess, then in a tense game of cat and mouse with Porfiry, the brilliant magistrate assigned to the murder investigation. A tour de force of suspense, Crime and Punishment delineates the theories and motivations that underlie a bankrupt morality.

Just two years after completing Crime and Punishment, which explored the mind of a murderer, Dostoevsky produced another masterpiece, The Idiot. This time the author portrays a truly beautiful soul a character he found difficult to bring to life because, as he wrote, beauty is the ideal, and neither my country, nor civilized Europe, know what that ideal of beauty is. The result was one of Dostoevsky’s greatest characters Prince Myshkin, a saintly, Christ like, yet deeply human figure."
Standalone Novels,The Eternal Husband,1870,"The most monstrous monster is the monster with noble feelings. This remarkably edgy and suspenseful tale shows that, despite being better known for his voluminous and sprawling novels, Fyodor Dostoevsky was a master of the more tightly focused form of the novella. The Eternal Husband may, in fact, constitute his most classically shaped composition, with his most devilish plot: a man answers a late night knock on the door to find himself in a tense and puzzling confrontation with the husband of a former lover but it isn t clear if the husband knows about the affair. What follows is one of the most beautiful and piercing considerations ever written about the dualities of love: a dazzling psychological duel between the two men over knowledge they may or may not share, bringing them both to a shattering conclusion. The Art of The Novella Series Too short to be a novel, too long to be a short story, the novella is generally unrecognized by academics and publishers. Nonetheless, it is a form beloved and practiced by literature’s greatest writers. In the Art Of The Novella series, Melville House celebrates this renegade art form and its practitioners with titles that are, in many instances, presented in book form for the first time."
Standalone Novels,Demons,1872,"In 1869 a young Russian was strangled, shot through the head and thrown into a pond. His crime? A wish to leave a small group of violent revolutionaries, from which he had become alienated. Dostoevsky takes this real life catastophe as the subject and culmination of Devils, a title that refers to the young radicals themselves and also to the materialistic ideas that possessed the minds of many thinking people in Russian society at the time. The satirical portraits of the revolutionaries, with their naivety, ludicrous single mindedness and readiness for murder and destruction, might seem exaggerated until we consider their all too recognisable descendants in the real world ever since. The key figure in the novel, however is beyond politics. Nikolay Stavrogin, another product of rationalism run wild, exercises his charisma with ruthless authority and total amorality. His unhappiness is accounted for when he confesses to a ghastly sexual crime in a chapter long suppressed by the censor. This prophetic account of modern morals and politics, with its fifty odd characters, amazing events and challenging ideas, is seen by some critics as Dostoevsky’s masterpiece."
Standalone Novels,The Adolescent,1875,"Book Jacket Status: JacketedThis superb new translation never before published of one of Dostoevsky’s major novels comes from the award winning translators Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky. The Adolescent originally published in English as A Raw Youth is markedly different in tone from Dostoevsky s other masterpieces. It is told from the point of view of the nineteen year old narrator, whose immaturity, freshness, and na vet are unforgettably reflected in his narrative voice. The illegitimate son of a landowner, Arkady Dolgoruky was raised by foster parents and tutors, and has scarcely ever seen his father, Versilov, and his mother, Versilov s peasant common law wife. Arkady goes to Petersburg to meet this accidental family and to confront the father who dominates his imagination and whom he both disdains and longs to impress. Having sewn into his coat a document that he believes gives him power over others, Arkady proceeds with an irrepressible youthful volatility that withstands blunders and humiliations at every turn. Dostoevsky masterfully depicts adolescence as a state of uncertainty, ignorance, and incompleteness, but also of richness and exuberance, in which everything is still possible. His tale of a youth finding his way in the disorder of Russian society in the 1870s is a high and serious comedy that borders on both farce and tragedy."

Standalone Novels,The Brothers Karamazov,1879,"The Brothers Karamazov, by Fyodor Dostoevsky, is part of the Barnes & Noble Classics series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras. Here are some of the remarkable features of Barnes & Noble Classics: All editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences biographical, historical, and literary to enrich each reader’s understanding of these enduring works. The last and greatest of Dostoevsky’s novels, The Brothers Karamazov is a towering masterpiece of literature, philosophy, psychology, and religion. It tells the story of intellectual Ivan, sensual Dmitri, and idealistic Alyosha Karamazov, who collide in the wake of their despicable father s brutal murder. Into the framework of the story Dostoevsky poured all of his deepest concerns the origin of evil, the nature of freedom, the craving for meaning and, most importantly, whether God exists. The novel is famous for three chapters that may be ranked among the greatest pages of Western literature. Rebellion and The Grand Inquisitor present what many have considered the strongest arguments ever formulated against the existence of God, while The Devil brilliantly portrays the banality of evil. Ultimately, Dostoevsky believes that Christ like love prevails. But does he prove it?A rich, moving exploration of the critical questions of human existence, The Brothers Karamazov powerfully challenges all readers to reevaluate the world and their place in it.

Short Story Collections,Poor Folk and Other Stories,1845,"With their penetrating psychological insight and their emphasis on human dignity, respect and forgiveness, Dostoyevsky’s early short stories contain the seeds of the themes that came to his major novels. ‘Poor Folk’, the author’s first great literary triumph, is the story of a tragic relationship between an impoverished copy clerk and a young seamstress, told through their passionate letters to each other. In ‘The Landlady’, Dostoyevsky portrays a dreamer hero who is captivated by a curious couple and becomes their lodger. Mr. Prokharchin, inspired by a true story, is a sly comedy centring on an eccentric miser, and Polzunkov is a powerful character sketch which, in common with the other tales in this volume, questions the very nature of existence."

Short Story Collections,A Gentle Creature and Other Stories,1876,"In these stories, Dostoevsky explores both the figure of the dreamer divorced from reality, and also his own ambiguous attitude toward utopianism, themes central to his great novels. In White Nights, the apparent idyll of the dreamer’s romantic fantasies disguises profound loneliness and estrangement from ‘living life.’ A Gentle Creature and The Dream of a Ridiculous Man show how withdrawal from reality can end in spiritual desolation as well as moral indifference, and how, in Dostoevsky’s view, the tragedy of the alienated individual can only be resolved by the rediscovery of a sense of compassion and responsibility toward other people. No other edition brings together these specific stories which are most interesting when read alongside one another and the new translations capture all the power and lyricism of Dostoevsky’s writing at its best.

By showing how Dostoevsky frames The Grand Inquisitor story in the wider context of the novel, this edition captures the sublety and power of Dostoevsky’s critique of modernity as well as his alternative vision of human fulfilment."
Short Story Collections,The Eternal Husband and Other Stories,1890,"The Eternal Husband and Other Stories brings together five of Dostoevsky’s short masterpieces rendered into English by two of the most celebrated Dostoevsky translators of our time. Filled with many of the themes and concerns central to his great novels, these short works display the full range of Dostoevsky s genius. The centerpiece of this collection, the short novel The Eternal Husband, describes the almost surreal meeting of a cuckolded widower and his dead wife s lover. Dostoevsky s dark brilliance and satiric vision infuse the other four tales with all too human characters, including a government official who shows up uninvited at an underling s wedding to prove his humanity; a self deceiving narrator who struggles futilely to understand his wife s suicide; and a hack writer who attends a funeral and ends up talking with the dead. The Eternal Husband and Other Stories is sterling Dostoevsky a collection of emotional power and uncompromising insight into the human condition."

Exploring many of the same themes as in his longer works, these small masterpieces move from the tender and romantic White Nights, an archetypal nineteenth century morality tale of pathos and loss, to the famous Notes from the Underground, a story of guilt, ineffectiveness, and uncompromising cynicism, and the first major work of existential literature. Among Dostoevsky’s prototypical characters is Yemelyan in The Honest Thief, whose tragedy turns on an inability to resist crime. Presented in chronological order, in David Magarshack’s celebrated translation, this is the definitive edition of Dostoevsky’s best stories."

Over the course of his journey he visited a number of major cities, including Berlin, Paris, London, Florence, Milan, and Vienna.
